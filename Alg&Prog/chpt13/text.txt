When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken      
at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to        
play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his         
injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he           
stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body,      
his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so            
long as he could pass and punt.                                             
  When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them,          
we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I                
maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years        
my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the           
summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo      
Radley come out.                                                            
  I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really          
began with Andrew Jackson. If General Jackson hadn't run the Creeks up      
the creek, Simon Finch would never have paddled up the Alabama, and         
where would we be if he hadn't? We were far too old to settle an            
argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted Atticus. Our father said        
we were both right.                                                         
  Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the        
family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the              
Battle of Hastings. All we had was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping              
apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his               
stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of           
those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more           
liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked        
his way across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence      
to Mobile, and up the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley's              
strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon            
made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy         
lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of         
God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having         
forgotten his teacher's dictum on the possession of human chattels,         
bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on           
the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint                 
Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and      
with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to      
an impressive age and died rich.                                            
  It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon's           
homestead, Finch's Landing, and make their living from cotton. The          
place was self-sufficient: modest in comparison with the empires            
around it, the Landing nevertheless produced everything required to         
sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles of clothing,             
supplied by river-boats from Mobile.                                        
  Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between      
the North and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of             
everything but their land, yet the tradition of living on the land          
remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when my            
father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger      
brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was        
the Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man           
who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering        
if his trot-lines were full.                                                
  When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and        
began his practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch's              
Landing, was the county seat of Maycomb County. Atticus's office in         
the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack, a spittoon, a         
checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His first two clients        
were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail. Atticus        
had urged them to accept the state's generosity in allowing them to         
plead Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives,           
but they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with          
jackass. The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb's leading blacksmith in      
a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a         
mare, were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three               
witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him        
was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in pleading           
Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus        
could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an           
occasion that was probably the beginning of my father's profound            
distaste for the practice of criminal law.                                  
  During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy         
more than anything; for several years thereafter he invested his            
earnings in his brother's education. John Hale Finch was ten years          
younger than my father, and chose to study medicine at a time when          
cotton was not worth growing; but after getting Uncle Jack started,         
Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked Maycomb, he      
was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him,        
and because of Simon Finch's industry, Atticus was related by blood or      
marriage to nearly every family in the town.                                
                                                                           
  Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first         
knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew        
on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was      
hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules             
hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the        
live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the          
morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps,         
and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and        
sweet talcum.                                                               
  People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in      
and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A        
day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. There was no              
hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy      
it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.           
But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb         
County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear          
itself.                                                                     
  We lived on the main residential street in town- Atticus, Jem and I,      
plus Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he        
played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.       
  Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones;         
she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and      
twice as hard. She was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking        
me why I couldn't behave as well as Jem when she knew he was older,         
and calling me home when I wasn't ready to come. Our battles were epic      
and one-sided. Calpurnia always won, mainly because Atticus always          
took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem was born, and I had      
felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember.                   
  Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was      
a Graham from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to      
the state legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen             
years his junior. Jem was the product of their first year of marriage;      
four years later I was born, and two years later our mother died            
from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her family. I did           
not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and           
sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off      
and play by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I          
knew better than to bother him.                                             
  When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime              
boundaries (within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry           
Lafayette Dubose's house two doors to the north of us, and the              
Radley Place three doors to the south. We were never tempted to             
break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an unknown entity the         
mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end;      
Mrs. Dubose was plain hell.                                                 
  That was the summer Dill came to us.                                      
  Early one morning as we were beginning our day's play in the back         
yard, Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford's        
collard patch. We went to the wire fence to see if there was a              
puppy- Miss Rachel's rat terrier was expecting- instead we found            
someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he wasn't much higher          
than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:                         
  "Hey."                                                                    
  "Hey yourself," said Jem pleasantly.                                      
  "I'm Charles Baker Harris," he said. "I can read."                        
  "So what?" I said.                                                        
  "I just thought you'd like to know I can read. You got anything           
needs readin' I can do it...."                                              
  "How old are you," asked Jem, "four-and-a-half?"                          
  "Goin' on seven."                                                         
  "Shoot no wonder, then," said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. "Scout        
yonder's been readin' ever since she was born, and she ain't even           
started to school yet. You look right puny for goin' on seven."             
  "I'm little but I'm old," he said.                                        
  Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. "Why don't you            
come over, Charles Baker Harris?" he said. "Lord, what a name."             
  "'s not any funnier'n yours. Aunt Rachel says your name's Jeremy          
Atticus Finch."                                                             
  Jem scowled. "I'm big enough to fit mine," he said. "Your name's          
longer'n you are. Bet it's a foot longer."                                  
  "Folks call me Dill," said Dill, struggling under the fence.              
  "Do better if you go over it instead of under it," I said.                
"Where'd you come from?"                                                    
  Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with         
his aunt, Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb        
from now on. His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother      
worked for a photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a         
Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars. She gave the money to         
Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times on it.                      
  "Don't have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the              
courthouse sometimes," said Jem. "Ever see anything good?"                  
  Dill had seen  Dracula,  * a revelation that moved Jem to eye him         
with the beginning of respect. "Tell it to us," he said.                    
                                                                           
  * In DOS versions italicized text is enclosed in  chevrons.               
                                                                           
  Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his      
shirt, his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff;        
he was a year my senior but I towered over him. As he told us the           
old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken; his laugh was              
sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of        
his forehead.                                                               
  When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded          
better than the book, I asked Dill where his father was: "You ain't         
said anything about him."                                                   
  "I haven't got one."                                                      
  "Is he dead?"                                                             
  "No..."                                                                   
  "Then if he's not dead you've got one, haven't you?"                      
  Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been      
studied and found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in               
routine contentment. Routine contentment was: improving our                 
treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the            
back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas based on the         
works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In        
this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character             
parts formerly thrust upon me- the ape in  Tarzan,  Mr. Crabtree in         
 The Rover Boys,  Mr. Damon in  Tom Swift.  Thus we came to know            
Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans,            
strange longings, and quaint fancies.                                       
  But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless          
reproductions, and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making         
Boo Radley come out.                                                        
  The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and            
explanations it drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no           
nearer than the light-pole on the corner, a safe distance from the          
Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole,             
staring and wondering.                                                      
  The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking      
south, one faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the          
lot. The house was low, was once white with a deep front porch and          
green shutters, but had long ago darkened to the color of the               
slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles drooped over the eaves      
of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains of a picket        
drunkenly guarded the front yard- a "swept" yard that was never swept-      
where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.                   
  Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed,      
but Jem and I had never seen him. People said he went out at night          
when the moon was down, and peeped in windows. When people's azaleas        
froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on them. Any           
stealthy small crimes committed in Maycomb were his work. Once the          
town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events: people's        
chickens and household pets were found mutilated; although the culprit      
was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in Barker's Eddy,           
people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their         
initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at              
night, he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as          
he walked. The Maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the              
Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their        
fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the children:      
Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard           
was a lost ball and no questions asked.                                     
  The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were           
born. The Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a          
predilection unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church,            
Maycomb's principal recreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley          
seldom if ever crossed the street for a mid-morning coffee break            
with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a missionary circle.         
Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and came back      
promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the           
neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew           
how old Mr. Radley made his living- Jem said he "bought cotton," a          
polite term for doing nothing- but Mr. Radley and his wife had lived        
there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember.                
  The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays,        
another thing alien to Maycomb's ways: closed doors meant illness           
and cold weather only. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal            
afternoon visiting: ladies wore corsets, men wore coats, children wore      
shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps and call, "He-y," of a           
Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did. The Radley        
house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any;         
Atticus said yes, but before I was born.                                    
  According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in      
his teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old        
Sarum, an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern            
part of the county, and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever        
seen in Maycomb. They did little, but enough to be discussed by the         
town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they hung around the           
barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and went to        
the picture show; they attended dances at the county's riverside            
gambling hell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; they experimented with      
stumphole whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr.           
Radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd.                            
  One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed         
around the square in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by                 
Maycomb's ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, and locked him in the courthouse      
outhouse. The town decided something had to be done; Mr. Conner said        
he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound and            
determined they wouldn't get away with it, so the boys came before the      
probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the              
peace, assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language          
in the presence and hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner         
why he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud        
he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them. The judge decided to          
send the boys to the state industrial school, where boys were               
sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food           
and decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr.            
Radley thought it was. If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley             
would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that           
Mr. Radley's word was his bond, the judge was glad to do so.                
  The other boys attended the industrial school and received the            
best secondary education to be had in the state; one of them                
eventually worked his way through engineering school at Auburn. The         
doors of the Radley house were closed on weekdays as well as                
Sundays, and Mr. Radley's boy was not seen again for fifteen years.         
  But there came a day, barely within Jem's memory, when Boo Radley         
was heard from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said      
Atticus never talked much about the Radleys: when Jem would question        
him Atticus's only answer was for him to mind his own business and let      
the Radleys mind theirs, they had a right to; but when it happened Jem      
said Atticus shook his head and said, "Mm, mm, mm."                         
  So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie               
Crawford, a neighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing.          
According to Miss Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting      
some items from  The Maycomb Tribune  to paste in his scrapbook. His        
father entered the room. As Mr. Radley passed by, Boo drove the             
scissors into his parent's leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his          
pants, and resumed his activities.                                          
  Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing         
them all, but when the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in        
the livingroom, cutting up the  Tribune.  He was thirty-three years         
old then.                                                                   
  Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any        
asylum, when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be          
helpful to Boo. Boo wasn't crazy, he was high-strung at times. It           
was all right to shut him up, Mr. Radley conceded, but insisted that        
Boo not be charged with anything: he was not a criminal. The sheriff        
hadn't the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so Boo was           
locked in the courthouse basement.                                          
  Boo's transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in           
Jem's memory. Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council         
told Mr. Radley that if he didn't take Boo back, Boo would die of mold      
from the damp. Besides, Boo could not live forever on the bounty of         
the county.                                                                 
  Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep         
Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained          
to the bed most of the time. Atticus said no, it wasn't that sort of        
thing, that there were other ways of making people into ghosts.             
  My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the             
front door, walk to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her            
cannas. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. Radley walking to and         
from town. He was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes, so               
colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp and         
his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss        
Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as        
his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radley's posture was         
ramrod straight.                                                            
  He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and      
say, "Good morning, sir," and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radley's         
elder son lived in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was         
one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place. From           
the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, people said the house died.            
  But there came a day when Atticus told us he'd wear us out if we          
made any noise in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in           
his absence if she heard a sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.           
  He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each      
end of the Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was      
diverted to the back street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of        
our house and walked to the Radley's every time he called. Jem and I        
crept around the yard for days. At last the sawhorses were taken away,      
and we stood watching from the front porch when Mr. Radley made his         
final journey past our house.                                               
  "There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into," murmured          
Calpurnia, and she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her        
in surprise, for Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white            
people.                                                                     
  The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come        
out, but it had another think coming: Boo's elder brother returned          
from Pensacola and took Mr. Radley's place. The only difference             
between him and his father was their ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan              
Radley "bought cotton," too. Mr. Nathan would speak to us, however,         
when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him coming from town        
with a magazine in his hand.                                                
  The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know,      
the longer he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the         
more he would wonder.                                                       
  "Wonder what he does in there," he would murmur. "Looks like he'd         
just stick his head out the door."                                          
  Jem said, "He goes out, all right, when it's pitch dark. Miss             
Stephanie Crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one          
time and saw him looking straight through the window at her... said         
his head was like a skull lookin' at her. Ain't you ever waked up at        
night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this-" Jem slid his feet           
through the gravel. "Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at      
night? I've seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin', and one        
night I heard him scratching on the back screen, but he was gone            
time Atticus got there."                                                    
  "Wonder what he looks like?" said Dill.                                   
  Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about                   
six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks; he dined on raw          
squirrels and any cats he could catch, that's why his hands were            
bloodstained- if you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood      
off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth      
he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of      
the time.                                                                   
  "Let's try to make him come out," said Dill. "I'd like to see what        
he looks like."                                                             
  Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do           
was go up and knock on the front door.                                      
  Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem  The Gray           
Ghost  against two Tom Swifts that Jem wouldn't get any farther than        
the Radley gate. In all his life, Jem had never declined a dare.            
  Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more        
than his head, for Dill wore him down easily: "You're scared," Dill         
said, the first day. "Ain't scared, just respectful," Jem said. The         
next day Dill said, "You're too scared even to put your big toe in the      
front yard." Jem said he reckoned he wasn't, he'd passed the Radley         
Place every school day of his life.                                         
  "Always runnin'," I said.                                                 
  But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in            
Meridian certainly weren't as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that          
he'd never seen such scary folks as the ones in Maycomb.                    
  This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped         
and leaned against the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily        
on its homemade hinge.                                                      
  "I hope you've got it through your head that he'll kill us each           
and every one, Dill Harris," said Jem, when we joined him. "Don't           
blame me when he gouges your eyes out. You started it, remember."           
  "You're still scared," murmured Dill patiently.                           
  Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasn't scared of         
anything: "It's just that I can't think of a way to make him come           
out without him gettin' us." Besides, Jem had his little sister to          
think of.                                                                   
  When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister        
to think of the time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: "If      
I got killed, what'd become of you?" he asked. Then he jumped,              
landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility left him until               
confronted by the Radley Place.                                             
  "You gonna run out on a dare?" asked Dill. "If you are, then-"            
  "Dill, you have to think about these things," Jem said. "Lemme think      
a minute... it's sort of like making a turtle come out..."                  
  "How's that?" asked Dill.                                                 
  "Strike a match under him."                                               
  I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell         
Atticus on him.                                                             
  Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful.                    
  "Ain't hateful, just persuades him- 's not like you'd chunk him in        
the fire," Jem growled.                                                     
  "How do you know a match don't hurt him?"                                 
  "Turtles can't feel, stupid," said Jem.                                   
  "Were you ever a turtle, huh?"                                            
  "My stars, Dill! Now lemme think... reckon we can rock him...."           
  Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: "I         
won't say you ran out on a dare an' I'll swap you  The Gray Ghost           
if you just go up and touch the house."                                     
  Jem brightened. "Touch the house, that all?"                              
  Dill nodded.                                                              
  "Sure that's all, now? I don't want you hollerin' something               
different the minute I get back."                                           
  "Yeah, that's all," said Dill. "He'll probably come out after you         
when he sees you in the yard, then Scout'n' me'll jump on him and hold      
him down till we can tell him we ain't gonna hurt him."                     
  We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the      
Radley house, and stopped at the gate.                                      
  "Well go on," said Dill, "Scout and me's right behind you."               
  "I'm going," said Jem, "don't hurry me."                                  
  He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the         
simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning         
and scratching his head.                                                    
  Then I sneered at him.                                                    
  Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped        
it with his palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray      
was successful. Dill and I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch,      
panting and out of breath, we looked back.                                  
  The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down        
the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny,         
almost invisible movement, and the house was still.                         
                                                                            

                                  2                                         
                                                                           
  Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him        
off on the five o'clock bus and I was miserable without him until it        
occurred to me that I would be starting to school in a week. I never        
looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertime had         
found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on        
multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me,      
learning their games, following Jem's red jacket through wriggling          
circles of blind man's buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and         
minor victories. I longed to join them.                                     
  Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually        
done by one's parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted          
to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this      
transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place      
I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem's pockets. When we slowed to a          
walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that         
during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him      
with requests to enact a chapter of  Tarzan and the Ant Men,  to            
embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind      
him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he          
would stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone.             
  "You mean we can't play any more?" I asked.                               
  "We'll do like we always do at home," he said, "but you'll see-           
school's different."                                                        
  It certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline        
Fisher, our teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and              
patted the palm of my hand with a ruler, then made me stand in the          
corner until noon.                                                          
  Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn          
hair, pink cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore        
high-heeled pumps and a red-and-white-striped dress. She looked and         
smelled like a peppermint drop. She boarded across the street one door      
down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinson's upstairs front room, and when        
Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a haze for days.               
  Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, "This          
says I am Miss Caroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from               
Winston County." The class murmured apprehensively, should she prove        
to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region.         
(When Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, Winston           
County seceded from Alabama, and every child in Maycomb County knew         
it.) North Alabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel           
companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no                 
background.                                                                 
  Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The         
cats had long conversations with one another, they wore cunning little      
clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time      
Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice         
the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. Miss             
Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and                  
floursack-skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed      
hogs from the time they were able to walk, were immune to                   
imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and      
said,  "Oh,  my, wasn't that nice?"                                         
  Then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous      
square capitals, turned to the class and asked, "Does anybody know          
what these are?"                                                            
  Everybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year.           
  I suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the            
alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows, and after              
making me read most of  My First Reader  and the stock-market               
quotations from  The Mobile Register  aloud, she discovered that I was      
literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. Miss Caroline      
told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere      
with my reading.                                                            
  "Teach me?" I said in surprise. "He hasn't taught me anything,            
Miss Caroline. Atticus ain't got time to teach me anything," I              
added, when Miss Caroline smiled and shook her head. "Why, he's so          
tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads."                   
  "If he didn't teach you, who did?" Miss Caroline asked                    
good-naturedly. "Somebody did. You weren't born reading  The Mobile         
Register."                                                                  
  "Jem says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead        
of a Finch. Jem says my name's really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I         
got swapped when I was born and I'm really a-"                              
  Miss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. "Let's not let our          
imaginations run away with us, dear," she said. "Now you tell your          
father not to teach you any more. It's best to begin reading with a         
fresh mind. You tell him I'll take over from here and try to undo           
the damage-"                                                                
  "Ma'am?"                                                                  
  "Your father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now."        
  I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I        
never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing        
illicitly in the daily papers. In the long hours of church- was it          
then I learned? I could not remember not being able to read hymns. Now      
that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that          
just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit            
without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of               
shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticus's              
moving finger separated into words, but I had stared at them all the        
evenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be        
Enacted into Laws, the diaries of Lorenzo Dow- anything Atticus             
happened to be reading when I crawled into his lap every night.             
Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not         
love breathing.                                                             
  I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and        
stared out the window until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of        
first-graders in the schoolyard. He asked how I was getting along. I        
told him.                                                                   
  "If I didn't have to stay I'd leave. Jem, that damn lady says             
Atticus's been teaching me to read and for him to stop it-"                 
  "Don't worry, Scout," Jem comforted me. "Our teacher says Miss            
Caroline's introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it          
in college. It'll be in all the grades soon. You don't have to learn        
much out of books that way- it's like if you wanta learn about cows,        
you go milk one, see?"                                                      
  "Yeah Jem, but I don't wanta study cows, I-"                              
  "Sure you do. You hafta know about cows, they're a big part of            
life in Maycomb County."                                                    
  I contented myself with asking Jem if he'd lost his mind.                 
  "I'm just trying to tell you the new way they're teachin' the             
first grade, stubborn. It's the Dewey Decimal System."                      
  Having never questioned Jem's pronouncements, I saw no reason to          
begin now. The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss             
Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed "the," "cat," "rat,"      
"man," and "you." No comment seemed to be expected of us, and the           
class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. I was          
bored, so I began a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline caught me writing         
and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. "Besides," she           
said. "We don't write in the first grade, we print. You won't learn to      
write until you're in the third grade."                                     
  Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy        
on rainy days, I guess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling        
the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet, then copying out a          
chapter of the Bible beneath. If I reproduced her penmanship                
satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of bread        
and butter and sugar. In Calpurnia's teaching, there was no                 
sentimentality: I seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me.            
  "Everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands," said Miss          
Caroline, breaking into my new grudge against Calpurnia.                    
  The town children did so, and she looked us over.                         
  "Everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk."               
  Molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced            
with metallic light. Miss Caroline walked up and down the rows peering      
and poking into lunch containers, nodding if the contents pleased her,      
frowning a little at others. She stopped at Walter Cunningham's             
desk. "Where's yours?" she asked.                                           
  Walter Cunningham's face told everybody in the first grade he had         
hookworms. His absence of shoes told us how he got them. People caught      
hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows. If Walter had      
owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and         
then discarded them until mid-winter. He did have on a clean shirt and      
neatly mended overalls.                                                     
  "Did you forget your lunch this morning?" asked Miss Caroline.            
  Walter looked straight ahead. I saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw.      
  "Did you forget it this morning?" asked Miss Caroline. Walter's           
jaw twitched again.                                                         
  "Yeb'm," he finally mumbled.                                              
  Miss Caroline went to her desk and opened her purse. "Here's a            
quarter," she said to Walter. "Go and eat downtown today. You can           
pay me back tomorrow."                                                      
  Walter shook his head. "Nome thank you ma'am," he drawled softly.         
  Impatience crept into Miss Caroline's voice: "Here Walter, come           
get it."                                                                    
  Walter shook his head again.                                              
  When Walter shook his head a third time someone whispered, "Go on         
and tell her, Scout."                                                       
  I turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus        
delegation looking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice           
already, and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that         
familiarity breeds understanding.                                           
  I rose graciously on Walter's behalf: "Ah- Miss Caroline?"                
  "What is it, Jean Louise?"                                                
  "Miss Caroline, he's a Cunningham."                                       
  I sat back down.                                                          
  "What, Jean Louise?"                                                      
  I thought I had made things sufficiently clear. It was clear              
enough to the rest of us: Walter Cunningham was sitting there lying         
his head off. He didn't forget his lunch, he didn't have any. He had        
none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day. He had           
probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his         
life.                                                                       
  I tried again: "Walter's one of the Cunninghams, Miss Caroline."          
  "I beg your pardon, Jean Louise?"                                         
  "That's okay, ma'am, you'll get to know all the county folks after a      
while. The Cunninghams never took anything they can't pay back- no          
church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of         
anybody, they get along on what they have. They don't have much, but        
they get along on it."                                                      
  My special knowledge of the Cunningham tribe- one branch, that is-        
was gained from events of last winter. Walter's father was one of           
Atticus's clients. After a dreary conversation in our livingroom one        
night about his entailment, before Mr. Cunningham left he said, "Mr.        
Finch, I don't know when I'll ever be able to pay you."                     
  "Let that be the least of your worries, Walter," Atticus said.            
  When I asked Jem what entailment was, and Jem described it as a           
condition of having your tail in a crack, I asked Atticus if Mr.            
Cunningham would ever pay us.                                               
  "Not in money," Atticus said, "but before the year's out I'll have        
been paid. You watch."                                                      
  We watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the        
back yard. Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps.        
With Christmas came a crate of smilax and holly. That spring when we        
found a crokersack full of turnip greens, Atticus said Mr.                  
Cunningham had more than paid him.                                          
  "Why does he pay you like that?" I asked.                                 
  "Because that's the only way he can pay me. He has no money."             
  "Are we poor, Atticus?"                                                   
  Atticus nodded. "We are indeed."                                          
  Jem's nose wrinkled. "Are we as poor as the Cunninghams?"                 
  "Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the         
crash hit them hardest."                                                    
  Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers            
were poor. As Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes            
were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers.                  
Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunningham's vexations. The acres         
not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and the little cash he made        
went to interest. If he held his mouth right, Mr. Cunningham could get      
a WPA job, but his land would go to ruin if he left it, and he was          
willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased. Mr.           
Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men.                     
  As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us      
with what they had. "Did you know," said Atticus, "that Dr. Reynolds        
works the same way? He charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for          
delivery of a baby. Miss Scout, if you give me your attention I'll          
tell you what entailment is. Jem's definitions are very nearly              
accurate sometimes."                                                        
  If I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would          
have saved myself some inconvenience and Miss Caroline subsequent           
mortification, but it was beyond my ability to explain things as            
well as Atticus, so I said, "You're shamin' him, Miss Caroline. Walter      
hasn't got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can't use any            
stovewood."                                                                 
  Miss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and        
hauled me back to her desk. "Jean Louise, I've had about enough of you      
this morning," she said. "You're starting off on the wrong foot in          
every way, my dear. Hold out your hand."                                    
  I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason          
anybody in Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method          
of sealing oral contracts. Wondering what bargain we had made, I            
turned to the class for an answer, but the class looked back at me          
in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up her ruler, gave me half a dozen      
quick little pats, then told me to stand in the corner. A storm of          
laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that Miss        
Caroline had whipped me.                                                    
  When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade      
exploded again, becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss            
Blount fell over them. Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet              
uninitiated in the mysteries of the Decimal System, appeared at the         
door hands on hips and announced: "If I hear another sound from this        
room I'll burn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the sixth grade           
cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket!"                    
  My sojourn in the corner was a short one. Saved by the bell, Miss         
Caroline watched the class file out for lunch. As I was the last to         
leave, I saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her          
arms. Had her conduct been more friendly toward me, I would have            
felt sorry for her. She was a pretty little thing.
